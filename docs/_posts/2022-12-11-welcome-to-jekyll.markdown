Built on the NVIDIA Omniverse platform, Isaac Sim is a robot simulation and synthesis data generation tool. Roboticists can use it to train and test robots more efficiently, simulating real-world interactions with a given environment that transcends the real world. With Isaac Sim, companies can dramatically reduce development, testing, and data acquisition costs. 


As an ecosystem partner of NVIDIA, ZVISION has collaborated with NVIDIA on Isaac sim's exploration in the field of LiDAR simulation. In addition to Isaac Sim's default mechanical LiDAR, ZVISION also explores simulation configurations for semi-solid LiDAR. The two attachments on this page are the model configuration files based on ZVISIONâ€™s long-range LiDAR ML-Xs and short-range LiDAR ML-30s, for the reference of those who are interested in Isaac Sim.
